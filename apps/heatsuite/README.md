# HeatSuite Watch Application

This is the HeatSuite Watch Application which allows for seemless integration into the HeatSuite platform (docs coming soon). You may use this watch application independent of the full(er) HeatSuite platform.  

## What is HeatSuite?

## Why do we need this?
Commercial enterprises have largely determined what researchers can measure in the field, or have postprocessing embedded into the 

## Watch Specific Features
This is a list of current features available when using the HeatSuite Watch Application:

+ Per minute averaging and/or sum of onboard watch sensor data (Heart rate, barometer temperature and pressure, accelerometer, battery)
+ Can connect external bluetooth devices for added physiological monitoring (e.g. Bluetooth Heart Rate, CORE Sensor) - more being added!
+ Connect and store data from other devices including:
    + Blood Pressure Monitor (A&D Medical UA651-BLE)
    + Oral Temperature using Custom Dongle - Contact [Nicholas Ravanelli, PhD](emailto:nick.ravanelli@gmail.com)
    + Body Mass Scale (Xiaomi Composition Scale 2)
+ Collect perceptions and behaviour using ecological momentary analysis with onboard questionnaires
+ Mictruition frequency and color analysis for index of hydration status
+ Create study schedules for participants to receive programmatic nudges daily, specific to each task
